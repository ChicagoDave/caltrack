PROGRESSION PLAN
Weeks 1-2: Learning phase

Use light weights, focus on perfect form
Should feel easy, you're just greasing the groove
Don't go to failure

Weeks 3-4: Find your baseline

Increase weight slightly each week
Last 2 reps of each set should feel challenging but doable
Still 1-2 reps away from failure

Week 5 onward: Progressive overload

When you can complete all sets with good form, increase weight by:

5 lbs for upper body exercises
10 lbs for leg press
2.5-5 lbs for smaller movements (shoulders, arms)




CRITICAL SAFETY NOTES FOR YOU
Your back/glute issue:

AVOID: Barbell squats, barbell deadlifts, heavy bent-over rows
BE CAUTIOUS: Romanian deadlifts (start super light), anything with spinal loading
If something feels "off" in that left glute area, STOP immediately

At 61:

Warm up 5 minutes on cardio equipment before lifting
Do dynamic stretches (arm circles, leg swings) after cardio
Never bounce or use momentum
Quality reps > heavy weight
Listen to joint feedback - sharp pain = stop

Form over ego:

You'll regain strength fast due to muscle memory
Don't rush the weights up - your connective tissue needs time to adapt
Bad form at 61 = injury that derails everything
